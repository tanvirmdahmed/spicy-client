1. First of all I created a json file according to the data of the requirement and then I created a server site.
2. Added navbar and footer for each page and the login and register pages are conditionally created.
3. I have created a website named Spicy in which I have loaded the data of 6 chefs from the server-side.
4. Then I added two sections as I want, one is Services and the other is Slider.
5. Clicking on view recipe from six chef data will take you to a new page where all the data of that individual chef will be displayed and the recipes will be shown in card form.
